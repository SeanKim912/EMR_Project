# About: CareCommand

CareCommand is a project that aims to demonstrate that an Electronic Medical/Health Record (EMR/EHR) application
might be faster and more productive for end users if they can type what they want directly into
a command-line instead of navigating a maze of buttons, links, and menus with traditional GUI-based
EMR's like Epic. It's the sort of EMR I wish I had when I worked in healthcare (I have experience with
private sector ambulances, in-hospital radiology and the emergency room).

EMR's are huge, complicated applications that can take upwards of hundreds of people to build and maintain,
so while I am continuing to add features, this project will probably never be fully finished and is more
a proof-of-concept.



**_This project is built with:_**

- JavaScript
- React
- Redux
- C#/.NET
- MongoDB
- Entity Framework
- HTML/CSS
- terminal-in-react npm package for command-line functionality

# Completed Features:

- Bash-like command line is in place and functional. Can clear terminal, help menu, and some other basic commands
for demonstration purposes.
- "define" command will look up medical terminology from the Merriam Webster Medical Dictionary API directly in the terminal.

# Planned Features:
- Medical and administrative charting features for visits, tests, procedures, census, rooming, etc.
- Access to publicly maintained API's like pharmaceutical databases for reference.
- HIPAA-compliant security features like timed-logouts and secure chart retrieval.
